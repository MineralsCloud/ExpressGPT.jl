Now generate 2 user inputs and your responses, with varying `np`, `template`, pressures
(with different units), and trial equations of state (only in the allowed types of EOS). You

ordered, how similar words or phrases are used, etc.

Now generate 1 user input and your response. But only return your response in JSON format. Do not print anything else.
